					<h2>International Partnerships</h2>
					<p class="content">
						International partnerships at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign include a wide range of activities carried out at various levels of our organizational structure. They include collaborative activities with other universities and institutions of higher education, governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private sector corporations. Typically, such collaborations arise from individual faculty members interacting informally with their colleagues abroad, whether it be in connection with shared research interests or common educational goals for their students. Truly dynamic and sustained international partnerships almost always originate with one or two enthusiastic and far-sighted faculty from each partner institution, who are committed to championing the collaboration among their colleagues and students.
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						It is often advantageous, and sometimes necessary, to formalize such collaborative links with foreign partners at the institutional level by recognizing these links in officially sanctioned written documents. On the Urbana-Champaign campus, oversight of all such formal documentation (broadly termed “international agreements”) of institutional linkages with foreign partners, on behalf of the Board of Trustees, is provided by the Director of Illinois Strategic International Partnerships (ISIP), in the executive offfice of International Programs and Studies.
					</p>
					<div class="content">
						Reporting to the Associate Provost for International Affairs, ISIP provides a consistent, centralized resource for:
						<ul>
							<li>
								developing new institutional linkages, by consulting with faculty and administrators to draft and negotiate international agreements
							</li>
							<li>
								maintaining and broadening existing linkages, by identifying key strategic partnerships and disseminating information about opportunities to expand and deepen these partnerships
							</li>
							<li>
								ensuring compliance with laws, regulations, and policies as established by the Board of Trustees and the State of Illinois, by working with the Office of University Counsel and the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research Administration to develop uniform guidelines and up-to-date legal language as a basis for international agreements
							</li>
							<li>
								providing an institutional record of past and present institutional linkages, by maintaining a database of current international partners, as well as a physical and electronic archive of documents that support formal institutional linkages

					<h3>ILLINOIS STRATEGIC INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS (ISIP)</h3>
					<p class="content">
						Illinois Strategic International Partnerships (ISIP) coordinates relationships with a small, select group of true peer institutions around the world that are both broadly and deeply impactful—crossing departments, colleges, centers and institutes to inform and enhance our core missions of research, education, public service, and economic development.
					</p>
					
					<h4>ISIP Vision statement</h4>
					<p class="content">
						We will advance the global standing of the University of Illinois as a preeminent public research university, by creating a truly “transnational” institution, where innovative knowledge, research, education, faculty, and students move freely across borders—whether geopolitical, cultural, disciplinary, or academic.
					</p>
					
					<h4>ISIP Strategy</h4>
					<p class="content">
						We will leverage existing relationships when possible—and cultivate new relationships when necessary—with a small, highly select group of true peer institutions around the world to form institutional partnerships that are both broadly and deeply impactful—crossing departments, colleges, centers and institutes to inform and enhance all of our core mission activities: research, education, public service, and economic development.
					</p>
					
					
					<h4>ISIP benefits to primary stakeholders</h4>
					<div class="content">
						Strategic International Partnerships can, and should, provide measurable benefits to our students and faculty, and to the citizens of the state of Illinois. Benefits from the partnerships envisioned in the ISIP initiative include:
						<ul>
							<li>
							enhanced integration of international education experiences into core curricula at Illinois
							</li>
							<li>
							enhanced participation by students in disciplines traditionally under-represented in study abroad (particularly in STEM disciplines where semester- or year-based study abroad often means additional time to degree)
							</li>
							<li>
							increased co-development of new courses, curricula and, eventually, dual and joint degrees
							</li>
							<li>
							enhanced opportunities for student cohorts from Illinois and ISIP partners to come together for research, learning, national and international competitions, or topical summer institutes
							</li>
							<li>
							increased access to significant external funding sources, both public and private, for collaborative research and education activities (e.g., European Commission Framework and Erasmus Mundus funding)
							</li>
							<li>
							enhanced potential to form truly productive multilateral consortia of university partners, building on strong existing relationships and identified synergies
							</li>
							<li>
							enhanced ability to conduct innovative, cross-, multi-, and interdisciplinary research on “big science” questions and problems, by leveraging complementary faculty expertise and research infrastructures
							</li>
							<li>
							increased opportunities to foster technological, commercial, and political connections for State of Illinois business and governmental interests with key foreign areas (ex. planned public housing authority informational visit to Stockholm; exchange of expertise on freight and passenger rail capacity and technology)
							</li>
							<li>
							increased opportunities for forging beneficial relations with multi-national corporations
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					
					
					
					<h4>ISIP Approach</h4>
					<p class="content">
						The central campus administration, through its senior international officer, will work with faculty and a variety of campus constituents to gather information about our existing partnerships, with the goal of identifying those with the greatest potential to be leveraged into broader strategic engagements. Once identified, modest financial support, as well as focused administrative support and oversight, will be provided as seed funding to broaden the scope of collaborative activities undertaken in the partnership. ISIP will rely on pre-defined, clearly articulated criteria and mechanisms for identifying, cultivating, evaluating, and sustaining strategic international partnerships:
					</p>
					
					<h4>The Pilot Project: Inspire</h4>
					<p class="content">
						The pilot project of the ISIP initiative is well underway. TheIllinois-Sweden Program for Educational and Research Exchange (INSPIRE), through the leadership of faculty liaisons Anna Stenport (Germanic Languages and Literatures, Scandinavian Studies) and Harry Dankowicz (Mechanical Sciences and Engineering) in cooperation with the Director of ISIP, is an ambitious project to form broad and deep engagements with the three leading institutions of higher education in Stockholm, Sweden: KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm University, and the Karolinska Institutet. The foundational relationship with KTH is already well-established, with faculty from our Colleges of Engineering, Liberal Arts and Sciences, Fine and Applied Arts, and Media all working directly on collaborative research and education projects with counterparts at KTH. For additional details, please explore the INSPIRE website.
					</p>
					
					<h4>The Africa Initiative</h4>
					<p class="content">
						ISIP’s Africa Initiative seeks to identify clusters of research and educational activities, and facilitate expansion of these engagements, with the particular goal of developing deep, sustained partnerships with institutions of higher education in Africa. Ideally, such partnerships will provide enhanced and expanded opportunities for our faculty and students to engage in innovative research and educational experiences, as well as continue our tradition of capacity building and public service across the continent. Desired outcomes of the ISIP Africa Initiative include an increased awareness of the breadth and depth of expertise related to Africa across our campus; enhanced efforts to recruit, enroll, and support African students at Illinois; increased engagement Illinois students in experiential learning abroad and service activities in Africa; an enlarged and strengthened ability to deliver courses and curricula focused on African languages, cultures, histories, and current affairs; expanded access to external funding for research and engagement projects in Africa; and an enhanced ability to bring to bear our strong tradition of cross- and interdisciplinary approaches to complex socio-political, economic, and environmental challenges unique to contemporary Africa.
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						The Illinois Strategic International Partnerships (ISIP) Africa Initiative seeks proposals from faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for partnership building projects in, or with a primary focus on, Africa. This grant competition supports activities that identify, implement, and expand upon academic collaborations that will advance and enhance the goals of the ISIP Africa Initiative. Grants of up to $5000 per project will be awarded to cover allowable expenses, including travel and lodging, expenses associated with hosting visiting faculty, researchers, or students from the partner institutions, joint symposia or workshops, public outreach events, use of distance learning technologies, or other appropriate expenses.

						<i>Deadline For Applications: MAY 1, 2012</i>
					</p>
					
					
					
					
					
					<h3>INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS</h3>

					<h4>General Agreement Guidelines</h4>
					<p class="content">
						Agreements between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and foreign partner institutions can range from informal (undocumented) “handshake” agreements between faculty to work together in areas of common interest, to formal (documented), legally binding contracts that obligate one or both partners to perform specific actions or provide specific services to the other. Any Illinois campus unit or faculty member may initiate an international agreement; however, we strongly encourage consultation with the Office of Illinois Strategic International Partnerships (ISIP) prior to any preliminary discussions to develop a draft agreement with an overseas institution. For agreements proposing to establish student exchange or fee-base study abroad programs, a consultation with the Study Abroad Office is also required. ISIP will evaluate the parameters of the proposed program to determine what, if any, additional review and oversight of the draft should be requested.
					</p>
					<div class="content">
						To ensure that maximum mutual benefit will result from such cooperation, there should first be an objective evaluation of the following aspects of the quality of the potential exchange partner:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The general quality and resources, and academic standing of the potential partner
							</li>
							<li>
								The potential for institutional support within UIUC for the exchange program
							</li>
							<li>
								The potential interest among UIUC students (for proposed student exchange agreements)
							</li>
							<li>
								The campus-wide advantage of the proposed exchange
							</li>
							<li>
								The overall value of the linkage with regard to the university’s strategic initiatives for international activity
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					
					
					<h4>Establishing a New Agreement</h4>
					<div class="content">
						Before entering into formal negotiation with the proposed partner institution, the Illinois campus unit or faculty member desiring to initiate a new agreement should consult with ISIP regarding issues cited below:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The general scope of the proposed cooperation
							</li>
							<li>
								Specific area/fields of cooperation
							</li>
							<li>
								Aspects of mutual responsibility
							</li>
							<li>
								Financial arrangements and services provided
							</li>
							<li>
								Intellectual property issues that may arise as a result of collaborative research
							</li>
							<li>
								Terms of the proposed exchange agreement and its renewal and termination
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p class="content">
						Campus units or faculty members wishing to establish a new international agreement should first complete the Application to Establish a Cooperative Agreement with a Foreign Institution and submit it to the Assistant Director for Institutional Collaboration in the ISIP prior to an initial consultation with the Assistant Director.
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						ISIP will provide assistance for drafting the exchange agreement and, when desirable, for negotiating the terms of the agreement with the potential overseas partner. When the draft exchange agreement has been completed and approved by the sponsoring unit and the foreign partner, ISIP will submit it to the relevant units for department- and college-level approvals.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Finalizing and Signing an Agreement</h4>
					<div class="content">
						In order for any Memorandum of Understanding or Memorandum of Agreement between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a foreign institution to be valid, it must be signed by:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The Chancellor of the Urbana-Champaign campus
							</li>
							<li>
								The Associate Provost for International Affairs of the Urbana-Champaign campus
							</li>
							<li>
								The Comptroller of the University of Illinois, or a duly appointed proxy
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p class="content">
						Generally, we sign the final Agreements first, and then send them to the foreign partner institution for signature there. The University of Illinois requires two signed original Agreement prints; one is archived in the office of the the Assistant Director for Institutional Collaboration, and the second is kept on file in the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research Administration (OSPRA). Foreign partners may request as many signed original prints of the final Agreement as they require.
					</p>
					
					
					<h4>Agreement Templates</h4>
					<div class="content">
						ISIP has developed a series of written instruments, encompassing varying levels of formality, to assist faculty, academic and administrative units in their interactions with existing or proposed international partners. OIC uses these instruments to provide a common starting point for drafting and negotiating agreements that are tailored to the particular needs of a given partnership. They include:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The Letter of Intent—an informal (i.e., non-binding) document that can be used to establish or document the initial stages of a partnership. These can be executed by colleges (bearing the signature of the dean), schools or research institutes(bearing the signature of the director) or academic units/departments (bearing the signature of the chair or head). Letters of intent should identify the initiating faculty and unit, and may identify particular areas of collaboration to be explored. They typically do not have defined termination dates. Copies of all Letters of Intent should be made available by the initiating unit to the OIC for institutional records.
							</li>
							<li>
								The Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs)—a more formal, but still non-binding document that recognizes the proposed linkage at the institutional level. MOUs have specified termination dates, and are signed on behalf of the campus by the chief executive officer (chancellor) and the senior international officer (Associate Provost for International Affairs), and on behalf of the university by the designated signatories of the Board of Trustees (comptroller and secretary). MOUs are a more public declaration of partnership, and are often useful in support of joint grant applications to external funding agencies, facilitating visa and travel document processing, and initial collaborative activities that involve an institutional presence of some kind (i.e., joint conferences, etc.). All MOUs must be processed through the OIC; one originally signed print is to be kept on file by the OIC, and a second originally signed print is to be kept on file by the Board of Trustees.
							</li>
							<li>
								The Memorandum of Understanding with Research Focus—an extension of the general MOU above, with provisions for the exchange of research personnel to explore potential joint research projects. Again, this document can be useful in support of joint grant applications, particularly to federal agencies here and abroad that specifically fund scientific research. Academic departments or research institutes on campus that have identified a partner institution with desirable/complementary research foci, facilities and equipment, etc., but have not yet articulated a specific joint research project may find this document useful. It establishes the potential for joint research, while at the same time protecting the researchers’ and university’s best interest by requiring a that more formal research agreement be executed prior to undertaking any specific joint research project. As with general MOUS, all research MOUs must be processed through the OIC; one originally signed print is to be kept on file by the OIC, and a second originally signed print is to be kept on file by the Board of Trustees.
							</li>
							<li>
								The Memorandum of Agreement (MOAs)—a formal, legally binding document, or contract, that sets forth specific terms, rights, and obligations of both partner institutions. MOAs tend to be highly customized to accommodate the needs of particular collaborative arrangements. Terms should be detailed and comprehensive, but still clear and concise. The duties and obligations stipulated in MOAs, whether financial or otherwise, are legally enforceable, and thus create liability for one or both parties. As a result, MOAs are subject to more active review and scrutiny by the OIC and University Legal Counsel. MOAs have specified termination dates and typically include “escape clauses” providing for early termination. Although they are, like MOUs, signed by the chief executive officer and senior international officer for the campus, in fact only the Board of Trustees is legally authorized enter into contractual obligations on behalf of the University of Illinois, and so their designated representative (i.e., the Comptroller) is the signatoriy required by law. The sample MOA linked above is a standard “closed pocket” reciprocal student exchange agreement.
							</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Kul Faculty Exchange Program</h3>				
					
					<img src="images/placeholder.png" style="width: 350px; height: 300px;"/>
				
					<p class="content">
						International Programs and Studies supports an ongoing faculty exchange program as one facet of our long-standing partnership with the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium. Founded in 1425, KUL is Belgium’s largest University. It offers programs in Medicine, Engineering, Agriculture, Applied Biological Sciences, Law, Business, Economics, Social Sciences, Arts, Basic Sciences, and various research programs on biotechnology, environmental and health sciences. Graduate instruction and research are conducted in English. Leuven, a beautifully preserved medieval city of about 90,000 inhabitants, is located only 20 minutes by train from Brussels and the international airport, and thus within very easy reach of other European capitals.
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						To date, nearly 40 faculty from a wide variety of disciplines have participated in this exchange. Beginning in January, 2009 the exchange has been opened to include advanced PhD students wishing to conduct research at the partner institution. Faculty and PhD candidates from either institution are eligible to apply for funding for an exchange visit of between one and three months under the terms of this agreement. The hosting institution provides housing and a modest living stipend, while the sending institution provides roundtrip airfare. U of I applications will be evaluated by an internal UIUC committee, and nominations will be forwarded to KUL for approval by a faculty committee of KUL. Preference will be given to applicants whose projects demonstrate the greatest potential for ongoing research and collaboration with KUL colleagues, and applicants are encouraged to approach their academic counterparts in Leuven prior to the application. If help is needed in this respect, please contact the Assistant Director for Institutional Collaboration. We may be able to offer assistance.
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						Faculty and PhD candidates at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who wish to participate in this exchange program may download guidelines and application materials here. The application deadlines for proposed exchange visits to KUL during the Spring and Summer sessions are typically at or around the beginning of October in the previous year. The application deadlines for proposed exchange visits to KUL during the Fall session are typically at or around the beginning of March of the year. However, these deadlines are subject to change and applications may not be accepted at all for certain semesters, in order to maintain a reasonable balance in this reciprocal exchange.

					<h3>FULBRIGHT PROGRAM</h3>
					
					<p class="content">
						The Fulbright Program is the flagship international educational exchange program sponsored by the U.S. government and is designed to “increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries.” With this goal as a starting point, the Fulbright Program has provided almost 300,000 participants—chosen for their academic merit and leadership potential — with the opportunity to study, teach and conduct research, exchange ideas and contribute to finding solutions to shared international concerns.
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						The Assistant Director for Institutional Collaborations has been designated as the Urbana-Champaign campus representative for the Fulbright Program, and the central liaison with the Council for International Exchange of Scholars (CIES), which administers the various Fulbright grants for faculty and professionals, on behalf of the U.S. Department of State. prior to any preliminary discussions to develop a draft agreement with an overseas institution. Through this office, International Programs and Studies disseminates information about various funding opportunities through the Fulbright Program to faculty and staff, as well as providing incoming Fulbright Senior Scholars with logistical support prior to and upon their arrival at Illinois.
					</p>

						We are equally proud of the record number of current University of Illinois students and recent alumni who were awarded scholarships by the Fulbright U.S. Student Program for the 2010-2011 academic year.
					</p>
					 
					Please join us in congratulating the following Illinois students and recent alumni on receiving Fulbright awards:
					Ryoji Amamoto, of Inverness, Ill., has been offered a Fulbright grant to Switzerland. He will spend next year at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne involved in research examining viral gene delivery in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease.
					Erik Connelly, of Schaumburg, Ill., has been awarded a Fulbright grant to teach English at the secondary grade level in Korea.
					Samuel Ero-Philips, of Minneapolis, will carry out projects in Nigeria with a Fulbright grant. He will spend his year in Ogun State constructing a mixed-use educational facility.

					Paul Hartley, of Las Cruces, N.M., will investigate how musical films contributed to forming and maintaining Turkish national identity between 1950 and 2001.
					Holly Holmes, of Stevens Point, Wis., will spend her Fulbright grant year conducting field research in Brazil, tracking the evolution of the musical movement “Clube da Esquina” during the military dictatorship in the 1960s until the return to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s.
					Jun Sung Hong, of Apple Valley, Calif., has been offered a Fulbright grant to South Korea. He will spend his year researching South Korean perceptions of peer victimization among children in school. He believes that with South Korea’s sustained increase in immigration rates, there is an interest in how these immigrant children are adjusting to peer conflicts, or bullying, in the education system.
					Anthony Jerry, of San Diego, will use his Fulbright grant in Mexico to gather dissertation research on how African descendants of Mexico’s southern Pacific coast confront contemporary processes of racialization and strategically participate in processes of racial formation and transformation to bring about social and material gains.
					Rachel Kimnach, of Montgomery, Ill., will be spending the 2010-11 academic year as a Fulbright scholar teaching English to middle school students in Germany. The Fulbright will provide her first overseas experience.
					Timothy Landry, of Houston, will travel to Benin to explore the interactions that occur between local religious practitioners of Vodun and international tourists.
					Dustin Lovett, of Edwardsville, Ill., was granted a Fulbright award to study the cultural interactions that affect the reception and quality of translation at the University of Vienna. After spending a year studying abroad as an Illinois undergraduate in Vienna, Lovett earned a translation internship with Dalkey Archive Press.
					Donnie Robinson, of New Orleans, will be spending the 2010-11 academic year teaching English in Turkey under a Fulbright grant.
					Renata Sheppard, of Falcon Heights, Minn., has been offered a Fulbright grant to Italy for next year. She will work with multimedia artists at Milan’s Studio Azzurro to create a technology-based collaborative, interactive, choreographic installation.
					Eva Shiu, of Skokie, Ill., has earned one of only two English teaching assistantships to Cameroon. She graduated in May 2010 with a bachelor’s degree in international studies and a minor in French. Shiu previously studied in Senegal and spent a summer teaching English in Kyrgyzstan.

					Fulbright Opportunities
					In addition to the Traditional Fulbright Scholar Program, CIES administers a variety of specialized grants for U.S. faculty, professionals, and education adminstrators:
					NCS Scholar Program
					The NCS Scholar Program brings together approximately thirty outstanding research scholars and professionals from the U.S. and abroad each year. Under the guidance of an appointed Distinguished Scholar Leader, NCS Scholars engage in collaborative, multidisciplinary examination of a topic of universal concern and together seek solutions to critical issues affecting all humankind.
					Fulbright Specialists Program
					The Fulbright Specialists Program is designed to provide short-term academic opportunities (two to six weeks) for U.S. faculty and professionals. Shorter grant lengths give specialists greater flexibility to pursue a grant that works best with their current academic or professional commitments.
					Fulbright Distinguished Chairs Program
					Awards in the Fulbright Distinguished Chairs Program are among the most prestigious appointments in the Fulbright Scholar Program, for senior scholars and have a significant publication and teaching record.
					Fulbright International Education Administrators Program
					The Fulbright International Education Administrators Program supports annual seminars to introduce participants to the society, culture and higher education systems in Germany, Japan or Korea through campus visits, meetings with foreign colleagues and government officials, attendance at cultural events and briefings on education. Participants gain new perspective on the need to internationalize U.S. campuses and insight into how it can be done.
					Fulbright German Studies Seminars
					Awardees in the Fulbright German Studies Seminars participate in a group seminar on current German society and culture and examine the political, social and economic institutions of Germany. Each seminar has a specific thematic focus. Annual seminars begin in Berlin and include visits to other cities in eastern and western Germany.
