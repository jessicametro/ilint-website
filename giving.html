					<h2>Giving Opportunities</h2>
						<h4>
							YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD: <br>Please help us broaden minds and expand horizons, one student at a time!
						</h4>
						<p class="content">
							The current generation of college students and teachers need to be culturally fluent in order to communicate with people from all over the world. According to University of Illinois Professor of Curriculum and Instruction Mark Dressman, &#8220;cultural competence&#8221; has now become an essential part of life in the 21st century. Today&#8217;s university students will inherit a workplace in which they will need to be prepared for &#8220;significant contact with the rest of the world.&#8221; Indeed, many potential employers now ask students not only if they&#8217;ve completed an internship but where their international internship experience took place as well.
						</p>
						<p class="content">
							Luckily, Illinois is a leader in international education. In fact, Illinois is one of a select few U.S. institutions of higher education ranking in the top 13 in the three key metrics of international education:
							<ul>
								<li>	International student enrollment </li>
								<li>	Total number of study abroad students </li>
								<li>	The number of federally-funded Title VI National Resource Centers for international and area studies </li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p class="content lastparagraph">
							Each year International Programs and Studies proudly recognizes the outstanding international achievements of our alumni, faculty and students whose professional contributions have made a significant impact on communities outside of the United States. Through their accomplishments International Achievement Award winners exemplify the strength of their education at the University of Illinois, while their dedication to the welfare of our fellow global citizens serves as an inspiration to the students, alumni, faculty, and staff of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as well as the general public.    
						</p>
						<p class="content">
							<b>The Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange</b>, published annually by the Institute of International Education, ranks Illinois 13th in the nation&#8217;s &#8220;top 20 Doctoral/Research Institutions&#8221; for total number of study abroad students and second (first among public universities) in terms of international students studying on campus. Illinois is poised to become the nation&#8217;s pre-eminent global university. 
						</p>
						<p class="content">
							However, we cannot attain that leadership status without your help. Your gift of any size will ensure that no Illinois student with a desire to enlarge his or her world and study, hold an internship or do research abroad is unable to do so because of lack of funds. (The average scholarship award for undergraduate study abroad students now is $1,200.)
						</p>
						<p class="content">
							International Programs and Studies (IPS) is the campus unit that organizes engagement for the campus with the global community. IPS is committed to providing students and faculty with the services, facilities, and programs they need to expand their horizons&#8212;and ours&#8212;by investigating and experiencing this global civilization in all its multifaceted complexity.
						</p>
						<p class="content lastparagraph">
							Whether you are interested in sponsoring an international case competition, organizing campus symposia on the international intersections of technology and government policy, or providing deserving students with scholarships to study in any of 380 sites all over the world, a gift to the International Programs and Studies Annual Fund provides unrestricted support to enhance and enlarge programs with the greatest needs.
